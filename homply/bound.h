---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This algorithm models the solved region of a link by a set of simple
  weaves and their associated polynomials, which are called tags.  Due to a
  nice result, any simple weave is uniquely defined by how its inputs are
  matched to its outputs.  A list of the outputs the inputs are matched to,
  in the order of the inputs, is enough to define a simple weave.
  Unfortunatly, there is no similar result about the associated tags.  Since
  I've never seen a workstation capable of storing 9! polynomials, it
  is reasonable to assume no weave of more than 8 inputs ever needs to be
  dealt with.  Weaves of 8 inputs have 16 boundary crossings, so any reduced
  weave with 8 inputs or less can be stored in (8 copies of 4 bits =32 bits).
  The size of an integer nowadays is, you guessed it, 32 bits.  Something of
  type WEAVE is just a simple weave and its tag.  BODY is a compressed
  representation of the simple weave itself.  TAG is the polynomial
  associated with that simple weave.

There are three representations of weave boundaries.
1) *list* is an array of words of size oldcross saying which crossing
   is attached to which other crossing.  If list[i]==j, list[j]==i.
2) The medium-size representation (two ub4's) stores the values of
   *list* for only the inputs (the output can be deduced).  Further, each
   value is stored in 5 bits, with 6 values per ub4.
3) The tiny representation recognizes that the medium-size representation
   is a permutation of the outputs, and permutations can be enumerated.
   The tiny representation is the number for that permutation.
