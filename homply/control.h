  Here's a sketch of the algorithm:
  The Homfly polynomial is calculated using a recursive formula that replaces
a given link with two intermediate links, and associates a polynomial with
each intermediate link.  The two new links differ at the single crossing
at which the recursive formula was applied.
  The base case is always links with no crossings.
  The obvious will produce a binary tree with about 2^n nodes, where each
node is an intermediate link and all the leaf links have no crossings.
  This approach applies the recursion formula to the crossings in all
intermediate links in the same order, which encourages duplicates among the
intermediate links.  Duplicate links are collected, their polynomials are
summed, then only one copy of each type of intermediate link needs to be
dealt with.
  The number of intermediate links at any point is n! or less, where n is the
ceiling(sqrt(#crossings)) or less.  Usually n never needs to exceed
sqrt(#crossings)/2, where #crossing is the number of crossings in the original
link.
